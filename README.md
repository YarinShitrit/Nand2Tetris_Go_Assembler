# Nand2Tetris_Go_Assembler

This project contains an implementation of an assembler for the nand2tetris computer architecture, written in Go.

The assembler is capable of converting assembly code written in the nand2tetris Hack assembly language into binary machine code that can be loaded into the architecture's ROM.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, you'll need to have Go installed on your machine. You can download and install it from the official Go website.

Once you have Go installed, you can clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nand2tetris-assembler-go.git
```
To build the assembler, run the following command in the project root directory:

```
go build
```
This will create an executable file in the project directory that you can use to assemble your nand2tetris Hack assembly code.


## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the project, feel free to submit a pull request with your changes. Please make sure that your code follows the Go code style guidelines and that any new features or changes are thoroughly tested.
